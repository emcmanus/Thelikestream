http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/4/25/ubuntu-hardy-setup-page-1 (user accounts, firewall, ssh config)
http://articles.slicehost.com/2008/4/25/ubuntu-hardy-setup-page-2 (mostly bash config)

Highlights:
- created new usergroup "wheel"
- created new user "emcmanus" - USE THIS USER FOR ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS
- Still allow password authentication in SSH
- Using apache, passenger

MySQL:
MySQL root user DOES require a password. It's your insecure pass.

Apache:
Config located in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
