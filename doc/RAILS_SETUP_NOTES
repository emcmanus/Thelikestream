	[ RANKING ALGORITHM ]
	
Essentially the reddit algoirthm with a slower decay. See: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=231168

Algorithm: Ts + 45000 * log( like_count )

Key:
Ts => Time, in Seconds, since 12:00am Sept. 1st
45000 => in seconds, eq. 12.5 hours
log => use log base 8, for a slower decay

Every vote pushes the submission into the future, with a weighted decay to compensate for popular stories.
